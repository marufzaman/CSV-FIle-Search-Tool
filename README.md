# CSV File Search Tool
### Project Summary:
It performs some selective search on the CSV file.

### Key Features:
- It has a menu to perform a selective search.
- Rather than directly call the cell number for a column or Row it performs name search on column or row to detect the column and row number.

#### This [file](https://github.com/marufzaman/CSV-FIle-Search-Tool/blob/master/csv_file_search_tool_using_python.py) will perform some selective search on the [air_quality_Nov2017.csv](https://github.com/marufzaman/CSV-FIle-Search-Tool/blob/master/air_quality_Nov2017.csv) file.
